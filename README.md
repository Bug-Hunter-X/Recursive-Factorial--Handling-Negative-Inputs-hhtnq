This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: the lack of handling for invalid inputs.  The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that will cause a RecursionError if a negative number is passed as an argument.  The solution, provided in `factorial_solution.py`, addresses this by explicitly checking for negative inputs and raising a ValueError.
